# CS 121 final project: recipedb app
TODO - instructions on how to use the app



notes:
- favorites table added -- make a function that lets users add favorite recipes (procedural sql)

- error handling: (i think this would be in app.py)
    * username already taken
    * user does not exist

kyla
* ER diagram 
  - DONE, sort of? I'm kind of unsure about it 
  - not sure if non chef users have features for er diagram?? do they have a table for preferences? tracking their usage???
  - also the er diagram has some relationships that i am unsure of (might just delete them if not going to implement them anyways bc extra)
* DDL 
  - DONE --- i think? have to look at ER diagram issues again, theres a few tables that I'm unsure about still
  - might need more comments
* load-data + csv files 
  - (missing csv for the extra tables ratings, cost, chefs users, and favorites)
  - TODO users, chefs
* passwords - DONE
* grant permissions - DONE probably
