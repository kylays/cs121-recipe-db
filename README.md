# recipe-db
TODO - instructions on how to use the app



notes:
- I removed the ingredient table since it didn't make sense why we had an ingredient name and id when these were just one to one
- will be replacing that table with chefs since need 5 tables

- not sure if non chef users have features for er diagram?? do they have a table for preferences? tracking their usage???
- also the er diagram has some relationships that i am unsure of (might just delete them if not going to implement them anyways bc extra)

- favorites table -- make a function that lets users add favorite recipes

- how to handle chefs in setup-passwords???


- error handling:
    * username already taken
    * user does not exist

kyla
* ER diagram 
  - DONE, sort of? I'm kind of unsure about it
